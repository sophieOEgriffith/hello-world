# hello-world
where feet touch wet sand

i'm stepping out into this my first virtual world, deeply ignorant of what i will find here.
i've never trusted worlds that exists in time but not space, but i know that these are the only dwellings of the future.
i want to love these worlds as much as i loved the worlds i've left behind.
